# Statistical Mechanics

In this course, I have studied

- Classical Statistics
- Bose-Einstein Statistics
- Fermi-Dirac Statistics
- Theory of Radiation

In Practicals, we did computer programming to 

- analysis of the behavior of a collection of particles in a box that satisfy Newtonian mechanics
- Study of transient behavior of the system
- Study probability of various macrostates in coin-tossing experiment versus number of heads.
- Computation of the partition function for the systems with a finite number of single particle levels and finite number of non-interacting particles N under Maxwell-Boltzmann/ Fermi-Dirac/Bose Einstein statistics
- Study Maxwell speed distribution function at different temperatures in a 3-dimension system
- Analysis of Specific Heat of Solids w.r.t temperature
    - Dulong-Petit law
    - Einstein distribution function
    - Debye distribution function
- Analysis of following functions with energy at different temperatures
    - Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
    - Fermi-Dirac distribution
    - Bose-Einstein distribution
- Analysis of distribution of particles w.r.t. energy in 3 Dimensions for
    - Relativistic and non-relativistic bosons both at high and low temperature.
    - Relativistic and non-relativistic fermions both at high and low temperature.
- Analysis of Planck’s law of Black body radiation w.r.t. wavelength/frequency at different
temperatures and its comparison with Rayleigh-Jeans Law and Wien’s distribution law for a
given temperature
